# MLCamera Demo

Demonstrates using Vision with Core ML to preprocess AVCaptureVideoDataOutput and perform image classification.

## Overview

Among the many features of the Core ML framework is the ability to classify input data using a trained machine-learning model. The Vision framework works with Core ML to apply classification features to images, and to preprocess those images to make machine learning tasks easier and more reliable.
